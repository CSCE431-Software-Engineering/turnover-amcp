# The ActivitiesHelper module is designed to provide view helper methods
# related to activity management within the application. These helper methods
# can be used to format activity data, generate HTML snippets, or provide
# utility functions that facilitate the presentation of activities in views.
# This module enhances the separation of concerns by encapsulating view-specific
# logic, making the views cleaner and more maintainable.
